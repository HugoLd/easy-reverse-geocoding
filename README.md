This project is made to find country based on latitude/longitude data without making API calls.

It is based on Polygons found in an outdated project https://github.com/totemstech/country-reverse-geocoding .

Dataset is not 100% accurate, known failure cases exist, especially near borders. But it should be enough for most needs.

Feel free to PR or request Polygons modifications.
